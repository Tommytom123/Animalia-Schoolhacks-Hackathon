Contributers: Tom Brouwers, Nic Leclerq </br>

Idea: </br>
Create a website that can be used to track flora and fauna. Can be used to help keep control of these populations and ensure they don't go extinct. </br>



Put usernames and passwords into SQL database </br>
Put animal location and type in the CSV file (Comma seperated value) so we can easily run ML </br>

What currently needs to be done: </br>
Allow users to place their own markers</br>
ML setup </br>
finsihing touches </br>
